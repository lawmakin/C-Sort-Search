# Sort & Search Algorithms in C

My intention here is to create simple C programs to solve sorting and searching in various different ways, ultimately 
amalgamating them into a single program to perform 
approximate speed tests on each algorithm.

## LinearSearch.c

This program performs a linear search, O(n), on a pseudo-randomly generated integer array, of user-specified size, for a user-specified value.

If found, the position where the value first appears in the array is printed out.
