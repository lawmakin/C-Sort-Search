# Sort & Search Algorithms in C

I decided to go through some of the algorithms I know and to 
also learn new ones, using Jay Wengrow's "A Common-Sense 
Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms".

My intention here is to create simple C programs to solve 
sorting and searching in various different ways, ultimately 
amalgamating them into a single program to perform 
approximate speed tests on each algorithm.

## LinearSearch.c

This program performs a linear search, O(n), on a 
pseudo-randomly generated integer array, of user-specified 
size, for a user-specified value.

## BinarySearch.c

This program performs a binary search, O(log n), on a 
sorted integer array, of user-specified 
size, for a user-specified value.
